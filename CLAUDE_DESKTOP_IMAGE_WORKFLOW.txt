CLAUDE DESKTOP - IMAGE-BASED FORM FILLING WORKFLOW
==================================================

When a user uploads an image and mentions a condition, follow this exact workflow:

STEP 1: EXTRACT FROM IMAGE
--------------------------
Look for and extract:
- Patient name (format: Last, First)
- Phone number (with area code)
- Drug name and strength
- Directions (exact wording)
- Disp Qty (this is the quantity/mitte)
- Rem Qty (this is the refills remaining)

STEP 2: MAP CONDITION TO BOX NUMBER
------------------------------------
Common mappings:
- "nail fungus" → Box 13 (Onychomycosis)
- "athlete's foot" → Box 16 (Tinea pedis)
- "UTI" or "bladder infection" → Box 28 (Urinary tract infection)
- "yeast infection" → Box 30 (Vaginal candidiasis)
- "cold sore" → Box 21 (Herpes labialis)
- "acne" → Box 2 (Acne)
- "rash" or "dermatitis" → Box 6 (allergic/contact)
- "heartburn" or "GERD" → Box 17 (Gastroesophageal reflux)

STEP 3: GENERATE CLINICAL INFORMATION
-------------------------------------
Based on the condition, generate:

Symptoms: (condition-specific symptoms)
Medical History: "No known drug allergies. No contraindications to [medication type]."
Diagnosis: (formal medical name)

STEP 4: FORMAT MEDICATION
-------------------------
EXACT FORMAT:
"[Drug name and strength] [formulation]. [Directions exactly as shown]. Quantity: [Disp Qty]. Refills: [Rem Qty]"

Then add helpful instructions based on condition.

STEP 5: CREATE JSON AND CALL MCP
---------------------------------
{
  "patient_name": "[From image]",
  "phn": "[If visible, otherwise use placeholder]",
  "phone": "[From image]",
  "condition_numbers": [box_number],
  "symptoms": "[Generated based on condition]",
  "medical_history": "[Standard or from image]",
  "diagnosis": "[Medical term for condition]",
  "medication": "[Formatted as above + additional instructions]"
}

EXAMPLE FOR NAIL FUNGUS
-----------------------
Image shows: Terbinafine HCl, apply to nails twice daily, Qty 30, Refills 0

You create:
{
  "patient_name": "Isenor, Kristofor",
  "phn": "1234567890",
  "phone": "(250) 937-1689",
  "condition_numbers": [13],
  "symptoms": "Thickened, discolored toenails with brittle texture. Yellow-brown discoloration.",
  "medical_history": "No known drug allergies. No contraindications to topical antifungals.",
  "diagnosis": "Onychomycosis (nail fungus)",
  "medication": "Terbinafine HCl topical. Apply to the affected area(s) topically (nails) twice a day. Quantity: 30. Refills: 0\n\nFile nails before application. Keep clean and dry. Apply to entire nail and surrounding skin. Continue for 6-12 months. Wear breathable shoes."
}

COMMON MEDICATION ADDITIONS BY CONDITION
----------------------------------------

UTI: "Increase fluid intake. Complete full antibiotic course. Avoid irritants."
Acne: "Cleanse gently. Avoid picking. Use non-comedogenic products."
